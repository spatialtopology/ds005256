## Abstract
Cognitive neuroscience has advanced significantly due to the availability of openly shared datasets. Large sample sizes, large amounts of data per person, and diversity in tasks and data types are all desirable, but are difficult to achieve in a single dataset. Here, we present an open dataset with N = 101 participants and 6 hours of scanning per participant, with 6 multifaceted cognitive tasks including 2 hours of naturalistic movie viewing. This dataset’s combination of ample sample size, extensive data per participant, more than 600 iso hours worth of data, and a wide range of experimental conditions — including cognitive, affective, social, and somatic/interoceptive tasks — positions it uniquely for probing important questions in cognitive neuroscience.
